### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Cam McHenry. I'm a software engineer that is passionate about building great web applications. I'm currently working at GitHub. I sometimes write about TypeScript and React on my [blog](https://camchenry.com/), as well as other general web topics.

Ask me about: Rust, data-oriented programming, JavaScript, mathematics, euro board games.
