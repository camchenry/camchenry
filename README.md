My name is Cam McHenry. I'm a software engineer that is passionate about building great web applications. I'm currently working at GitHub. I sometimes write about TypeScript and React on my [blog](https://camchenry.com/), as well as other general web topics.

#### Tools

I also enjoy writing [tools](https://camchenry.com/tools), some of which you can find here:

- [CacheCheck](https://cachecheck.net/) - Check HTTP caching headers for any URL on the web
- [Is It Worth It To Automate?](https://camchenry.com/tools/worth-it-to-automate) - Calculator to figure out whether a repeated task is worth automating based on how much time it would save you
